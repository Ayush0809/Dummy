In this project, we use Satellite Imagery and Tensorflow's Object Detection API to detect Illegal Mining Activities and plot them on a real-time projected Map.

The architecture used in this implementation for Object Detection is Faster-RCNN. Faster-RCNN is a Region based Object Detection Algorithm.
